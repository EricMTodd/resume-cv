      <p>Hailing from Provo Utah and currently residing Glendale Colorado, I am a passionate producer of visual design as well as an eternal student of computer science. I have been exposed to computers all my life. I eagerly learned to use them in order to facilitate my artistic, gaming, and programming interests. The early years of my design career began with sketching, which rapidly matured to graphic design using photoshop and illustrator. In 2010 I was introduced to HTML and CSS through an introductory web development class. I showed great aptitude in the class after already having several years of home-spun and graphic design experience. In 2012 I was introduced to Python through a basic robitcs and programming class. Little did I know that these two classes would become the foundation for my greatest passion in life.</p>

      <p>After graduating high school, I spent some time at Utah Valley University without much drive or direction. Instead I focued on working and exploring my identity and desires. After working logistics and press operation for several screen-printing shops and warehouses, I found a great longing to pursue the intersection of passion for design and love for interactive computer media. After some research, I decided to take a 3 month long JavaScript Coding Bootcamp at General Assembly. That's where I truly fell in love with coding. It opened my mind to whole new worlds of possiblity I never could have imagined before. The class did not leave me feeling as prepared as I had expected and my journey since then has been rocky.</p>

      <p>A few years, a pandemic and lots more work later, I have continued to pursue my dreams of being a web developer. I have since been in a 3 month long internship where I learned to use Ruby on rails. I was one of 4 candidates selected to particpate where one would be chosen as a permanent hire. Unfortunately, I was not selected as the hire. However, the lessons I learned there have been invaluable.</p>

      <p>Today, I am close to mastering my skills with Ruby on Rails and React. My abilities with CSS have increased exponentially, and I couldn't have done it without The Odin Project. I spend at least an hour every day coding. I am working on several projects, some of them for friends and some are personal. I use personal projects to test ideas and design theories, while my other projects are much more professional in nature. You can see many of my projects through my GitHub account. Please note that most of my projects from the bootcamp have been removed and only the work I have been doing through The Odin Project is currently represented; with the exception of a raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript project from the early days of the bootcamp.</p>

      <p>I'm currently working as a screen-printer for Next Level Resource Partners and Harrow Sports. I am looking for new opportunites all the time and work hard to achieve my goals. I have acute attention to details and high standards of excellence. I leave nothing half finished and never cut corners. I'm friendly, kind and have excellent communication skills. I'm albe to remain cool under pressure and love collaborative problem solving. Feel free to contact me any time, as I'm always happy to make new connections!</p>
